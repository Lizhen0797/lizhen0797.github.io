  The technique of group secret handshake (GSH) has been used to help the members affiliated with the same group in achieving private authentication. After executing GSH protocols, the participants affiliated with the group can compute a shared secret key, or generate a public encryption key while the true participants can self-compute their decryption keys. This paper presents a concrete GSH protocol with Multiple Groups. Only a legitimate member can prove that it belongs to a set of legitimate affiliations, but which affiliation it belongs to will not be leaked. The Group Authority can reveal the real identities of the fellows in the proposed scheme after analyzing the flow of communication. The proposed scheme can provide affiliation-hiding and detectability. In addition, it achieves Perfect Forward Secrecy.
